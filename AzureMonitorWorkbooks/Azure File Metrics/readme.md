## Support - Azure File Metrics

**Warning Most of these workbooks are built to be used in an Azure Lighthouse Environment.**

**This workbook is great for analyzing:**

  - Overview of all Azure File storage accounts, private endpoints, and logs
  - Custom logs can be added to show utilization and other details from the storage accounts. 
  - Performance metrics for latency, bandwidth, and throttling can also be found lower on the performance tab.
